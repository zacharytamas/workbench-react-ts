# `workbench-react-ts`

This repo is just the base from which I start my React projects. It's a workbench for me to try out new things and experiment with different approaches. It's not meant to be a production-ready boilerplate, but rather a playground for me to try out new things.

The workflow is generally like this:

1. I have a new idea I want to play with so I create a new branch and start working on it.
1. If I end up making anything on it that seems like it might be useful or a multiplier for future experiments, I might extract those parts out into a branch like `main` that will help future ideas because I'll inherit those benefits when I branch from there again.

This will mean, though, that the most interesting parts of this repository will likely not ever be actually shared with the world directly through here but rather in other projects after I graduate them from the workbench.
